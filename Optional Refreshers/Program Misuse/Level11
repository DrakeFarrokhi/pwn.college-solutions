1. cd ../..
2. ./challenge/babysuid_level11
3. command ./usr/bin/od command is now available | od command results in dumps file contents in octal form or others via flags, capture the flag with ./usr/bin/od -c (prints file contents in form of ascii chars) flag
4. the format isn't the greatest but easily adjustable in a text editor by doing ./usr/bin/od -c flag > ./home/hacker/temp
5. we now have the output saved in our temporary file so we can edit it with ./usr/bin/nano flag to manually remove the junk
6. get the flag in nice format by running cat ./home/hacker/temp
