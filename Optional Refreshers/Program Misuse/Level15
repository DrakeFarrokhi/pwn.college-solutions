1. cd ../..
2. ./challenge/babysuid_level15
3. command ./usr/bin/base64 is now available | base64, intuitively, prints file contents out in base 64
4. with intuition we can know that this will output in the same way as base64 so we can pipe the info to temp ./usr/bin/base64 flag > ./home/hacker/temp
5. and capture the flag with ./usr/bin/base64 -d ./home/hacker/temp to get the flag
