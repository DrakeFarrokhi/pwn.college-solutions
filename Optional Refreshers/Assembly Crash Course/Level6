1. begin the challenge with ./../../challenge/run - in this challenge we will be doing the modulus operator! We want to store the output of rdi % rsi into rax to complete the challenge
2. start by entering our file with touch asm.S and nano asm.S
file, name=asm.S:
.intel_syntax noprefix
.section .text
.global _start

.text
_start:
  mov rax, rdi; div rsi
  mov rax, rdx # remainder of division operations is stored in rdx
3. we can now compile and convert our file to binary with as -o asm.o asm.S and then objcopy -O binary --only-section=.text asm.o asm.bin
4. and pipe our binary into the challenge to capture the flag with cat asm.bin | ./../../challenge/run
