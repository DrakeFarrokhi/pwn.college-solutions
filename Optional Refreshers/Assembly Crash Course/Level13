1. Start the challenge by running ./../../challenge/run - in this challenge we are tasked with setting the value of rax into the memory address 0x404000
2. Begin by creating our file and editing it with touch asm.s and nano asm.s
file, name=asm.s:
.intel_syntax noprefix
.section .text
.global _start

_start:
  mov [0x404000], rax
3. Now compile and convert the code to binary with as -o asm.o asm.s and objcopy -O binary --only-section=.text asm.o asm.bin
4. and pipe the binary into the challenge with cat asm.bin | ./../../challenge/run
