1. begin the challenge with ./../../challenge/run - in this challenge we will be adding a value (0x331337 to rdi)
2. let's begin by making our file with touch ./asm.S and nano asm.S to start coding
file, name=asm.S:
.intel_syntax noprefix
.section .text
.global _start

.text
_start:
  add rdi, 0x331337
  mov rax, 60
  syscall
3. now compile our file with as -o asm.o asm.S and convert it to binary with objcopy -O binary --only_section=.text asm.o asm.bin
4. and capture the flag by piping in the binary with cat ./asm.bin | ./../../challenge/run
