1. Begin the challenge by running ./../../challenge/run - in this challenge we are tasked with incrementing the value stored at [0x404000] by 0x1337 and storing the original value into rax and the incremented value
into [0x404000]
2. We start by creating our file and editing it with touch asm.s and nano asm.s
file, name=asm.s:
.intel_syntax noprefix
.section .text
.global _start

.text
_start:
  mov rax, [0x404000]
  add rax, 0x1337
  xchg rax, [0x404000]
3. We now need to get the binary by compiling and converting into binary with as -o asm.o asm.s and objcopy -O binary --only-section=.text
4. Capture the flag by piping the binary into the challenge with cat asm.bin | ./../../challenge/run
