1. we begin the challenge by running the start file via ./../../challenge/run
2. from here we can see that we need to set the rax register to 0x1337, r12 to 0xCAFED00D1337BEEF and rsp to 0x31337 
file, name=asm.S:
.intel_syntax noprefix
.section .text
.global _start

.text
_start:
  mov rax, 0x1337
  mov r12, 0xCAFED00D1337BEEF
  mov rsp, 0x31337

-oddly enough we don't need to make a syscall for our file to exit here so we can no compile the program with as -o asm.o asm.S and convert it to binary with objcopy -O binary --only_section=.text asm.o asm.bin
3. we can capture the flag by piping the binary to our challenge file with cat ./asm.bin | ./../../challenge/run
