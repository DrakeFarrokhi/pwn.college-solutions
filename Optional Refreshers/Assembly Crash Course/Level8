1. start the challenge with ./../../challenge/run - we can see that our task this time is to find the division remainder after dividing by powers of two which can be translated to x % 2^n -> n first bits of x
- they want us to move numbers dynamically provided in rdi and rsi into rax and rbx respectively which we do by accessing particular parts of the register
2. to start let's create our file with touch asm.s and then nano asm.s to open the text editor
file, name=asm.s:
.intel_syntax noprefix
.section .text
.global _start

.text
_start:
  mov al, dil 
  mov bx, si
3. we can now compile and convert our compilied file to binary with as -o asm.o asm.s and objcopy -O binary --only-section=.text asm.o asm.bin
4. and we can capture the flag by piping the binary with cat asm.bin | ./../../challenge/run
