1. Start the challenge with ./../../challenge/run - in this task we are challenged with swapping the values of rdi and rsi via the stack
2. Create and edit our file with touch asm.s and nano asm.s
file, name=asm.s:
.intel_syntax noprefix
.section .text
.global _start

.text
_start:
  push rdi
  push rsi
  pop rdi
  pop rsi
3. Compile and convert the code to binary with as -o asm.o asm.s & objcopy -O binary --only-section=.text asm.o asm.bin
4. Capture the flag by piping the binary with cat asm.bin | ./../../challenge/run
