1. Start the challenge with ./../../challenge/run - in this challenge we are tasked with making rsi perform an absolute jump to the location 0x4030000
2. Create and edit a file with touch asm.s and nano asm.s
file, name=asm.s:
.intel_syntax noprefix
.section .text
.global _start

.text
_start:
  mov rax, 0x403000
  jmp rax1
3. Compile and translate the code to binary with as -o asm.o asm.s & objcopy -O binary --only-section=.text asm.o asm.bin
4. Capture the flag by piping the binary with cat asm.bin | ./../../challenge/run
