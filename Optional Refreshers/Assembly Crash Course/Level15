1. Start the challenge with ./../../challenge/run - in this challenge we are tasked with setting rax to the lower byte of the value stored at 0x40400
2. Begin by creating our file and editing it with touch asm.s and nano asm.s
file, name=asm.s:
.intel_syntax noprefix
.section .text
.global _start

.text
_start:
  mov al, [0x40400] # lower byte register of rax will not overflow into the rest of rax so we only get the lower byte of 0x40400
3. Now compile and convert the file into binary with as -o asm.o asm.s and objcopy -O binary --only-section=.text asm.o asm.bin
4. And pipe the binary into the challenge to get the flag with cat asm.bin | ./../../challenge/run
