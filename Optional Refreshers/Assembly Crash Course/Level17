1. Start the challenge with ./../../challenge/run - in this challenge we are tasked with setting the values at the reference rdi and rsi registers to 0xdeadbeef00001337 and 0xc0ffee0000 respectively
2. Start by editing a file with touch asm.s & nano asm.s
file, name=asm.s:
.intel_syntax noprefix
.section .text
.global _start

.text
_start:
  mov rax, 0xdeadbeef00001337
  mov rbx, 0xc0ffee0000
  mov [rdi], rax
  mov [rsi], rbx
3. Then compile and conver to code to binary with as -o asm.o asm.s & objcopy -O binary --only-section=.text asm.o asm.bin
4. and capture the flag by piping the binary with cat asm.bin | ./../../challenge/run
