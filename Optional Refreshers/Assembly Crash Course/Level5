1. start the challenge with ./../../challenge/run - in this challenge we are doing a dividor operation (rdi / rsi -> rax)
2. start the challenge by creating our file and editing with a text editor with touch asm.S and nano asm.S
file, name=asm.S:
.intel_syntax noprefix
.section .text
.global _start

.text
_start:
  mov rax, rdi; div rsi
3. compile and convert our assembly code to binary with as -o asm.o asm.S and objcopy -O binary --only-section=.text asm.o asm.bin
4. pipe the binary to the challenge/run file and capture the flag with cat asm.bin | ./../../challenge/run
