1. Start the challenge with ./../../challenge/run - in this challenge we are tasked with adding two consecutive quad words stored at rdi and save the value in rsi
2. Make our file with touch asm.s and nano asm.s
file, name=asm.s:
.intel_syntax noprefix
.section .text
.global _start

.text
_start:
  mov rax, [rdi]
  mov r12, [rdi + 8]
  add rsi, rax
  add rsi, r12
3. Now compile the code and convert to binary with as -o asm.o asm.s and objcopy -O binary --only-section=.text asm.o asm.bin
4. Capture the flag by piping the binary with cat asm.bin | ./../../challenge/run
