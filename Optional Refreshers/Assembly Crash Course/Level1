1. we begin by starting the challenge by running ./../../challenge/run and exiting after receving the instructiosn via a keyboard interput ctrl + c
2. we can now open up a text editor to write our assembly code to the complete the challenge with touch asm.S and can open the file with nano asm.S
3. from here we can start writing our assembly code and the first thing we want to do is set intel_syntax noprefix, specify where the assembler should start, and create a section for it
Code:
.intel_syntax noprefix
.section .text
.global _start

.text
_start:
  mov rdi, 0x1337 # set our rdi register to 0x1337
  mov rax, 60 # setting rax register to 60 for syscall exit
  syscall # exits the program

4. we can now save the file with ctrl + S and exit with ctrl + X from here we can create an object file of our source code with as -o asm.o asm.S
5. now we object copy the assembled code to binary for our challenge with objcopy -O binary --only-section=.text asm.o asm.bin
6. and to capture the flag we pipe the binary into the challenge with cat ./asm.bin | ./../../challenge/run and receive the flag
