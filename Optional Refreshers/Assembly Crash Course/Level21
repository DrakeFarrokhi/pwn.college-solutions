1. Start the challenge with ./../../challenge/run - in this challenge we are tasked with averaging the top 4 quadword values that are stored on the stack without using pop and pushing that value onto the stack
2. Create and edit our file with touch asm.s & nano asm.s
file, name=asm.s:
.intel_syntax noprefix
.section .text
.global _start

.text
_start:
  add r12, [rsp]
  add r12, [rsp + 8]
  add r12, [rsp + 16]
  add r12, [rsp + 24]
  mov rsi, 4
  mov rax, r12; div rsi
  push rax
3. Compile and convert our code to binary with as -o asm.o asm.s & objcopy -O binary --only-section=.text asm.o asm.bin
4. Capture the flag by piping the binary with cat asm.bin | ./../../challenge/run
