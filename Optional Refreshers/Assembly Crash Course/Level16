1. Start the challenge with ./../../challenge/run - in this task we are tasked with setting rax to the byte at 0x404000, rbx to the word (2 bytes) at 0x404000, rcx to the double word (4 bytes) at 0x40400, and
rdx to the quad word (8 bytes) at 0x404000
2. Begin by creating a file and editing it with touch asm.s and nano asm.s
file, name=asm.s:
.intel_syntax noprefix
.section .text
.global _start

.text
_start: 
  mov al, [0x404000] # first byte of rax
  mov bx, [0x404000] # first two bytes of rbx
  mov ecx, [0x404000] # first 4 bytes of rcx
  mov rdx, [0x404000] 
3. We can now get our binary with as -o asm.o asm.s and objcopy -O binary --only-section=.text asm.o asm.bin
4. and capture the flag by piping the binary with cat asm.bin | ./../../challenge/run
